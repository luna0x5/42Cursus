## üó£Ô∏è About 42

	42 is a global education initiative that offers a new way of learning technology:
	no teachers, no classrooms, students learning from their fellow students (peer to peer
	learning), with a methodology that develops both computing and life skills. The 42 cursus is
	free for whoever is approved in its selection process* - the so-called "Piscine" - becoming
	thus "cadets" (42's students).

\* For further information about 42's **selection process** (the "Piscine"), please visit the [The Pool](https://1337.ma/en/the-pool/).

## üåå 42's galaxy (curriculum)

**42cursus** comprises two groups of projects: the first one being known as _"inner circle"_ and the second one, _"outer treks"_ - due to the **Holy Graph** layout (see image below).

The **inner circle** is the basic curriculum, with all projects being mandatory to attain level 7 - which is the minimum level required for activities such as internships and interchange.

The **outer treks** is a collection of diverse project trails in subjects ranging from operational systems to web development which allows cadets to specialize on whatever subject they prefer.
